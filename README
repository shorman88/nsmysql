1.  What is this?

This, my friend, is the MySQL internal driver for AOLserver 3.
Considering that AOLserver is now open source (hurray!), that means
people will want to play with it.  Chances are, if you're looking at
open source tools, you've also considered, or are running MySQL,
another fine open source product.

Well, since AOLserver's very suitable as a tool for creating
database-backed web sites, and MySQL is free as well, I thought they'd
make a good pair.  And, luckily for us, AOLserver was designed in such
a nice fashion that everything is modular, down to the database
interface. So, writing a new driver for AOLserver for a new database
is a fairly easy exercise.

This module has been tested with:

  AOLserver 3.4.2, MySQL 3.23.36, under x86 Linux 2.4.10 glibc 2.2.

The driver may or may not work on older versions, as it is modified
to work with the most recent releases and therefore may break
backwards compatibility.  If this is an issue, please contact me.

I make no guarantees that this will work "out of the box" on other
platforms, but I can't see why not.  If you find that things need
modification to make them work on your platform, please send me
patches.

2.  Who is responsible?

Well, I guess since I put this together, I'm mostly responsible.
If it doesn't work, try not to blame me, and instead submit
patches.  :-)

I'm Dossy <dossy@panoptic.com>.

3.  Where do I get it?

For now, the "official" sources will be:

  Website:

To get MySQL, go to:

4.  How do I use it?

Well, until there's time to write a more robust explanation, I'll give
a brief walk-through and a sample for your nsd.tcl config file.
Clearly, change the user, password, and datasource settings to match
your setup.

(Note:  If you're using this under Win32, please read win32/README,
in addition to this README.)

** This driver is compatible with MySQL 5.5+ **

Step 1:  Make sure MySQL is properly installed and working.

  This may seem like a silly step, but the number of times
  I've had to deal with "my foo isn't working" when the
  "foo" component *directly* depends on the "bar" component
  working.

Step 2:  Configure the Makefile (if necessary).

  Since every system is potentially different, there may
  be some need to slightly modify the provided Makefile.

  The only thing you should really have to change in the
  Makefile is the MYSQL_PREFIX variable.  By default, it's
  set to /usr/local.  I believe this is the default prefix
  for MySQL.  If you didn't use --prefix=/usr/local when
  configuring MySQL, then you'll need to modify MYSQL_PREFIX
  in nsmysql's Makefile.

  Optionally, if you didn't install the MySQL libraries and
  the include headers in the default places, you can specify
  where they are installed by editing MYSQL_LIBDIR And
  MYSQL_INCDIR, respectively.

  I've recently received complaints that there's some problem
  with "uncompress" being undefined.  The exact error message
  looks something like this in your logs/server.log file:

    Warning: modload: failed to load '/some/path/nsmysql.so':
    '/some/path/nsmysql.so: undefined symbol: uncompress'
  
  This has to do with the newer MySQL client library using
  libz for compression.  Uncomment the line in the Makefile
  that looks like:

  MODLIBS  +=  -lz

  Optionally, you may need to specify where your libz.{a,so}
  file lives.  Use something that looks like:

  MODLIBS  +=  -L/path/to/libz -lz

Step 3:  Compile the driver.

  Simple.  If you're reading this README, chances are you're
  already in the right directory.  If you're not, well then
  cd into the $srcdir/nsmysql directory.  Then, type:

  $ make

  (Caveat:  I believe you must use GNU Make for this.)

  Assuming it compiles, and produces the necessary nsmysql.so,
  then you want to install it into the $srcdir/root directory:

  $ make install

  If you've already got an installation of AOLserver elsewhere,
  and don't want to go overwriting it all with a new $srcdir/root,
  then you can tell make to copy the driver to the right place:

  $ make install PREFIX=/path/to/your/installation

Step 4:  Tell AOLserver about it.

  Now, you want to tell AOLserver about your handy-dandy MySQL
  driver.  You need to edit your nsd.tcl (or whatever you named
  your config. tcl file) and add the necessary stuff to make it
  use the new nsmysql.so.  I'm too lazy to read the AOLserver
  documentation to you, so go to http://www.aolserver.com/ and
  read it yourself.  If you're too lazy to go read it, I've
  included sample lines to stick in your nsd.tcl.

  The format for the datasource parameter is
 
    hostname:port:database

  Note:  setting ns_param verbose on will cause lots of noise to
  fill your server log, as it's how I debug the driver. :-) Doing a
  [ns_db verbose $db on] in an ADP will turn it on as well.  Don't
  forget to [ns_db verbose $db off] before the ADP ends, otherwise
  all ADPs that use that MySQL connection in the pool will also
  spit out debugging noise.
